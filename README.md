# Wild blueberry Yield Prediction
Welcome to the Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction project! This project aims to predict the yield of wild blueberries using machine learning techniques. We have developed a predictive model based on various environmental factors such as clone size, bee populations, temperature ranges, rainfall, and fruit characteristics. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical data of wild blueberry yields along with corresponding environmental variables. We have employed gradient boosting machine (GBM) regression to train the model, which has shown promising results in accurately predicting the yield of wild blueberries. Additionally, we have deployed a Plumber API endpoint that allows users to make predictions on new data using the trained model. Whether you're a farmer, researcher, or enthusiast interested in understanding and predicting wild blueberry yields, this project provides valuable insights and tools to assist you in your endeavors.
